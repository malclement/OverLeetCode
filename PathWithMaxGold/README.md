# Gold Mine Problem Solver

## Description

This project provides a solution to the Gold Mine problem, where you are given a grid representing a gold mine with cells containing gold amounts. The objective is to determine the maximum amount of gold you can collect following specific movement and collection rules.

## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid of integers where each cell represents the amount of gold in that cell, with `0` indicating an empty cell. You can start collecting gold from any cell that contains gold and can move left, right, up, or down to adjacent cells. However, you cannot revisit a cell you have already visited in the same path, and you cannot visit a cell with `0` gold.

Your task is to find the maximum amount of gold you can collect.

## Running Tests

To run the test file execute the following command:

```bash
python3 test_longest_sub_str.py
```
